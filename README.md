### Model Training:
Resumes are reviewed for job descriptions, educational levels, technical skills, languages and locations.<br /> 
Certain terms are added to a CSV to create a dictionary for IBM Watson to learn from.<br /> 
IBM Watson's training begins with the CSV and continues when resumes are being reviewed.<br />
With every resume being reviewed, IBM Watson becomes smarter and start scoring the resumes.<br />

IBM Watson continously learns and becomes even better at scoring resumes.<br /> 
The employer can make the hiring decision based on the data from IBM Watson.<br />
Candidates can learn from the algorithm to determine how to customize their resumes.<br />
